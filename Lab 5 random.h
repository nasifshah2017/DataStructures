 * is unpredictable.  During the debugging phase, it is best not
 * to call this function, so that program behavior is repeatable.
 * Otherwise only call it once at the start of use of random values.

 * or equal to high, with each value having equal probability.

 * ---------------------------------

 * 0 (meaning never) and 1 (meaning always).  For example, calling
 * RandomChance(.30) returns true 30 percent of the time.
