 * Interface file for a standard deck of cards without jokers.
 *
 * Must call Shuffle() before any others or no cards can be dealt.
 *
 * Mode of use is typically:
 *
 *    card_t card;
 *    Shuffle();
 *    while (Cards()) {
 *       card = Draw();
 *       DisplayCard(card);
 *    }
 *
 * Also has functions to Display a hand of cards stored in an array,
 * and to sort the hand by suit and value or just by value.
 *
 * If more than one deck is desired, call Decks(n) before calling Shuffle.
